# QuoteGenerator

#Victories
- downloaded custom font
- made custom image
- manipulated CSS grid to get each div to display as needed

#challenges
- CSS is ruff
- I wanted to center the button within its div but instead I made it the same width so it would line up with the quote box underneath it.
- also this webpage is totally not responsive at all and that makes me sad but its ok
